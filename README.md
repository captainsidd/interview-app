#interview-app
==================================

##Installation
-----------------------------------------

First, clone the repo. Make sure Meteor is installed. Then,

```bash
cd interview-app
npm install
meteor
```
This will launch the application at http://localhost:3000.

##Thoughts
-----------------------------------------
1) A good two day challenge. Felt the pressure, but never the panic.  A plus point of the exercise: I had a tough time getting back into the swing of Meteor and Blaze, but by the end I felt comfortable, so this was an opportunity to reintegrate back into Meteor before starting work.

2) Facebook API was fun to play with. Definitely would recommend as a starter project for people to work on.

3) Known bugs: didn't have enough time to fully flesh out the login page - once you sign in, it won't automatically kick you over to the home page. Other than that, a few style things such as the Facebook icon in the post page, and mobile hasn't been rigidly tested, although the app looks decent on most devices.
